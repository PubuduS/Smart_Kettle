- DallasTemperature **3.9.0** (Need DS18B20 Temperature Sensor)
	  
- Firebase Arduino WiFiNINA **1.2.5** (Need for FireBase Realtime Database)

- WiFiNINA **1.8.13** (Need for onboard WiFi)

### Idea behing this project ###
Our motivation of this project is to learn how to apply hardware interrupts (i.e. sensor readings) and software interrupts (i.e. timer interrupts) of a micro-controller effectively.
Moreover, we are curious to explore creative ways that aligns with the class material to prioritize processes of an operating system by manipulating the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
Despite being a common application, we believe that a simple scenario such as boiling water will help us focus on the technical aspect of the project, which is to gain a deeper
understanding of ISR.
